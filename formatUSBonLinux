Introduction

Occasionally, it is necessary to format the USB drive (for example, when changing the file system or deleting data). However, many Linux users are afraid to start the formatting process, thinking it is either a very complicated or time-consuming task.


Using three quick and simple methods
    Terminal
    Disk Utility
    GParted tool
    
    
Prerequisites  
	A system running Linux
	A USB drive
	Access to the terminal/command line
	A user account with sudo/root privilege
	
	
	
Which File System to Use for USB Formatting?
    FAT32
    NTFS
    exFAT

Method 2:
	Let's do it by Terminal

To list usb or harddisk drives
	df or lsblk 


Unmount and Format USB Drive
	sudo umount /dev/sdb1
	
To format a USB drive with FAT32 file system, use:

	sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1

To format a USB drive using the NTFS file system run:

	sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1

To format a USB drive in accordance with the exFAT file system use:

	sudo mkfs.exfat /dev/sdb1
	

Verify USB Drive Formatting
	sudo fsck /dev/sdb1

To mount this usd=sdb1
	Create a folder like: sudo mkdir /Test
	And mount the sdb1 to folder like: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /Test
	Now you can use the usbdrive.
	
	
Method 2: Open Disk Utility
To open the Disk Utility:

    Launch the Application menu.
    Type “disk” in the search bar.
    Click the Disks icon and ....
    
    
Method 3: Format USB Using GParted Tool
	sudo apt install gparted
	 
Run the GParted tool with
	sudo gparted
